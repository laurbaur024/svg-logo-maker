# SVG Logo Generator

## Activity

- I have created a logo generator using node.js, inquirer, and created the logos with SVG.
- Using the prompts, users may select a shape, text, and colors to generate a unique logo.
- I also have performed unit tests using jest to make sure the app is functioning correctly.
- Use the command 'npm run test' to perform these tests.

## User Instructions

- Open the terminal and invoke the prompts using the command 'node index.js'
- You will see a series of prompts in the terminal. Answer all the questions and a logo will be generated in the directory you are in. 

## Video

- Here is a link to the video of the working code.
